# [Project 1: Forecasting Consumer Price Index (CPI) of Singapore](https://github.com/ChuaMervin/SG_CPI/blob/main/Academic%20Project.pdf)
Perform statistical analysis to forecast the Consumer Price Index of Singapore for the month of February 2019.
## Project Overview
* Plotting of graph to understand the trend and pattern of the Consumer Price Index of Singapore over the years.
* Ensure that the times series we are working on is stationary by making the appropriate adjustment. 
* Making use of the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) to determine the number of lags required for our auto regression model.
* Forecast the monthly CPI for the month of February and obtained a 95% forecast interval for it by using our auto regression model.
* Reverse engineer the adjustment made previously to get the correct forecast value.

# [Project 2: Predicting the survival of the passenger on Titanic](https://github.com/ChuaMervin/Titanic_ML/blob/main/Titanic%20ML.ipynb)
Data Science project that utilizes machine learning models to predict the survival outcome of the passenger on the Titanic shipwreck.
## Project Overview
*	The data set was obtained from the Kaggle competition Titanic â€“ Machine Learning from Disaster.
*	Import the dataset by using the pandas library.
*	Test and check on how well each feature correlate with survival.
*	Convert categorical features into numerical values so that it can be feed into the machine learning models.
*	Dropping features that are highly incomplete and do not really contribute in predicting the survival outcome of the passengers.
*	Making use of machine learning models [Logistic Regression, KNN or k-Nearest Neighbours, Support Vector Machines (SVM), Naive Bayes classifier, Decision Tree, Random Forrest] to train and predict the required solution
*	K Stratified fold was also used to cross validate the data.
*	Sieving out the best model and using it to predict the solution.
*	Appending the result into an excel file and upload it into the Kaggle competition


# [Project 3: Dogs vs Cats Classifier](https://github.com/ChuaMervin/Dogs-vs-Cats/blob/main/Dogs%20vs%20Cats%20Classification.ipynb)
Data Science project that utilizes deep learning convolutional neural network for image classification.
## Project Overview
*	The images dataset was obtained from the Kaggle competition Dogs vs. Cats
*	Created functions to preprocess the images data into numpy array using cv2 so that it can be feed into the models.
*	Plotting of graph to ensure that the data has been correctly imported.
*	Train the model using a baseline CNN.
*	Improve on the result by utilizing pre-trained CNN VGG16 and fine tuning it to achieve an accuracy of around 90% 
*	Appending the result into an excel file and upload it into the Kaggle competition
